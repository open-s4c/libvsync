_Lock-free concurrent skiplist._ 

**Groups:** [Linearizable](../GROUP_linearizable.md), [Lock-free](../GROUP_lock_free.md), [SMR-required](../GROUP_requires_smr.md)

> **Note:** users can configure the maximum levels the skiplist can use by defining `-DVSKIPLIST_MAX_HEIGHT=H`. `H=32` by default.

##  Function `vskiplist_init`

```c
static void vskiplist_init(vskiplist_t *lst, vskiplist_cmp_node_t fun_cmp, vskiplist_handle_node_t fun_retire, void *fun_retire_arg, vuint32_t rand_seed, vskiplist_node_t *head, vskiplist_node_t *tail)
``` 
_Initializes the skiplist._ 


> **Note:** call it before threads start accessing the skiplist.



**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object. 
- `fun_cmp`: function pointer. This function is used to compare a given skiplist node against a given key. It must return the following:
- container(node)->key == key -> 0
- container(node)->key < key -> -1
- container(node)->key > key -> 1 

- `fun_retire`: function pointer to callback retire function. 
- `fun_retire_arg`: the second parameter of `fun_retire`. 
- `rand_seed`: a random seed used in random node height generation. 
- `head`: the address of the dynamically allocated head sentinel object of size `VSKIPLIST_SENTINEL_SZ`. 
- `tail`: the address of the dynamically allocated tail sentinel object of size `VSKIPLIST_SENTINEL_SZ`.


> **Note:** both `head` and `tail` must have size `VSKIPLIST_SENTINEL_SZ`.

> **Note:** `head` and `tail` must never be modified directly by the user, and they must be allocated before `vskiplist_init`. They can be freed only after `vskiplist_destroy`. i.e. they must have a life span larger or equal to `lst`. 


##  Function `vskiplist_destroy`

```c
static void vskiplist_destroy(vskiplist_t *lst)
``` 
_Destroys all existing nodes in the skiplist._ 


> **Note:** the destruction is done by calling retire function on all remaining nodes.

> **Note:** call after threads are done accessing the skiplist. 

**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object. 




##  Function `vskiplist_lookup`

```c
static vskiplist_node_t* vskiplist_lookup(vskiplist_t *lst, vskiplist_key_t key)
``` 
_Searches for the skiplist node associated with the given key._ 




**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object. 
- `key`: the key you are looking for. 


**Returns:** vskiplist_node_t* address of the skiplist node associated with the given key if exists. 

**Returns:** NULL if no node associated with the given key was found.

> **Note:** call within SMR critical section. 


##  Function `vskiplist_calc_node_sz`

```c
static vsize_t vskiplist_calc_node_sz(vskiplist_t *lst, vsize_t container_sz, vsize_t *height)
``` 
_Calculates the required size and height of_ `vskiplist_node_t` _container._ 




**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object. 
- `container_sz`: the size of the container object returned by sizeof. 
- `height`: output parameter. Indicates to how many levels the node will be connected to in the skiplist.


**Returns:** vsize_t the minimum required size of the container object of `vskiplist_node_t`.

> **Note:** users must call this function everytime they wish to add a new node to the skiplist. see `vskiplist_add`.

> **Note:** if the node is not embedded in a container struct. Pass `container_sz` as `sizeof(vskiplist_node_t)`. 


##  Function `vskiplist_add`

```c
static vbool_t vskiplist_add(vskiplist_t *lst, vskiplist_key_t key, vskiplist_node_t *node, vskiplist_node_t **out_node, vsize_t height)
``` 
_Inserts_ `node` _into the skiplist._ 




**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object. 
- `key`: the key associated with `node`. 
- `node`: address of vskiplist_node_t object. 
- `out_node`: output parameter contains the address of the existing node associated with the given key, if the key already exists and insertion failed, otherwise it contains NULL. 
- `height`: the value of the output param `height` updated by `vskiplist_calc_node_sz`.


**Returns:** true the key did not exist, and `node` is added successfully. 

**Returns:** false the key already exists, `node` is not added.

> **Note:** call within SMR critical section.

> **Note:** `out_node` can be NULL.

> **Note:** see `vskiplist_calc_node_sz` for container size calculation. 


##  Function `vskiplist_remove`

```c
static vbool_t vskiplist_remove(vskiplist_t *lst, vskiplist_key_t key)
``` 
_Removes the skiplist node associated with the given key._ 




**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object. 
- `key`: the key associated with the node you want to remove. 


**Returns:** true a node associated with the given key has been found and removed. 

**Returns:** false no node associated with the given key was found.

> **Note:** call within SMR critical section. 


##  Function `vskiplist_lookup_next`

```c
static vskiplist_node_t* vskiplist_lookup_next(vskiplist_t *lst, vskiplist_key_t key)
``` 
_Searches for the skiplist node associated with the given key._ 


Similar to `vskiplist_lookup` looks for a node associated with the given `key`, however if no such node is found it returns the address of the node associated with key `k` such that `k > key` and there is no key  `k `such that`key < k' < k`.

> **Note:** extension API 

**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object. 
- `key`: the key you are looking for. 


**Returns:** vskiplist_node_t* the address of the node associated with key if found, otherwise it returns the address of the node associated with `k > key`. If there is no such `k` it returns NULL.

> **Note:** call within SMR critical section. 


##  Function `vskiplist_get_succ`

```c
static vskiplist_node_t* vskiplist_get_succ(vskiplist_t *lst, vskiplist_node_t *curr)
``` 
_Returns the successor of the given node_ `curr` _if a successor exists._ 


> **Note:** a successor satisfies `container(succ)->key > container(curr)->key` and there exists no node n such that `container(succ)->key > container(n)->key <blockquote>container(curr)->key`, otherwise `n` is the successor 

> **Note:** extension API, the user is responsible for making sure that curr points to a valid non-reclaimed node 

**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object. 
- `curr`: address of a skiplist node. 


**Returns:** vskiplist_node_t* address of the successor: if successor exists NULL: if successor does not exist or curr has been removed.

> **Note:** call within the same SMR critical section where `curr` was retrieved. 


##  Function `vskiplist_get_first`

```c
static vskiplist_node_t* vskiplist_get_first(vskiplist_t *lst)
``` 
_Returns the first node in the given_ `lst`_._ 


i.e. the element that is mapped to the smallest key.

> **Note:** nodes that are logically removed (i.e. marked) are treated as nonexistent. 

**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object. 


**Returns:** vskiplist_node_t* address of the first node.

> **Note:** call within SMR critical section. 


##  Function `vskiplist_remove_node`

```c
static vbool_t vskiplist_remove_node(vskiplist_t *lst, vskiplist_key_t key, vskiplist_node_t *node)
``` 
_Removes the given node associated with the given key if it exists._ 


It fails if no node associated with the given key was found, or if the found node is not the same as the given node.

> **Note:** extension API, the user is responsible for making sure that the expected_node `node` is valid and points to a non-reclaimed memory. 

**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object. 
- `key`: the key associated with the node to remove. 
- `node`: address of the node to remove. 


**Returns:** true the node associated with the given key has been removed. 

**Returns:** false there is no node associated with the given key, or the existing node is different than the given node.

> **Note:** call within the same SMR critical section where `node` was retrieved. 


##  Function `vskiplist_cleanup`

```c
static void vskiplist_cleanup(vskiplist_t *lst)
``` 
_Triggers the physical removal of all logically removed nodes._ 


It is a modified copy _vskiplist_find.

> **Note:** this function is experimental and subject to removal. 

**Parameters:**

- `lst`: address of vskiplist_t object.


> **Note:** call within SMR critical section.
